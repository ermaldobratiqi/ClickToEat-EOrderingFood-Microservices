# ClickToEat-EOrderingFood-Microservices
This project was initiated to facilitate communication between food businesses and customers as well as to increase food sales from different food businesses, creating the ability for consumers to order food through our application.
Online food ordering system is a process in which one can order various food and drinks from several local restaurants and hotels through the use of the internet, simply by sitting at home or anywhere. And the order is delivered to the indicated place.
The project connects different restaurants with customers and contains an administrator (manager) and user side. All management like editing page content, updating food items, adding restaurants and checking order status can be managed by admin. There can be multiple managers in the app.
To order the food items, the user needs to create an account and log in, also the food comes with cost. This project makes a convenient way for customers to buy food online, without having to go to a restaurant.
For the features of this system, it contains the administrator (manager) section and the user (client) section. All edits, updates, management of order, food item and restaurant details are from the admin section, while customers can go through the page and place orders only if they want to. The design of this system is simple so that the user does not have difficulties while working with it.
